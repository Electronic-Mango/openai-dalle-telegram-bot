# Simple OpenAI image model Telegram bot

A simple and unofficial Telegram bot wrapping [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/) image models (like [DALLÂ·E](https://openai.com/dall-e-3)), build with [`python-telegram-bot`](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot)!

Just send a prompt and the bot will respond with a generated image!



## Requirements

This bot was built with `Python 3.12`, [`python-telegram-bot`](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot) and [`openai-python`](https://github.com/openai/openai-python).
Full list of Python requirements is in the `requirements.txt` file, you can use it to install all of them.



## Configuration

Configuration is done through a `.env` file. You can copy example file `.env.example` as `.env` and fill required parameters.

```commandline
cp .env.example .env
```


### Telegram bot

Only required parameter is a [bot token](https://core.telegram.org/bots#creating-a-new-bot).

You can also restrict who can access the bot via `ALLOWED_USERNAMES`.
You can specify multiple usernames delimited by space.
If you don't want to restrict the bot at all you can remove this parameter or leave it empty.


### OpenAI API

There are two required parameters - [API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) and [used model](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/dall-e).

```dotenv
OPENAI_TOKEN='<your secret API key>'
OPENAI_MODEL='dall-e-3 or dall-e-2'
```

Through `.env` you can also configure level of logging of OpenAI API through `OPENAI_LOG` parameter.
You can set it to `debug` or `info`.
```dotenv
OPENAI_LOG='debug or info'
```



## Commands

* `/again` - generates new image for last received prompt
* `/start` or `/help` - prints a simple start message
